                <p>The history  of  automobilebegins  as  early  as  1769,  with  the  creation  of steam  
                    engine  automobiles  capable  of  human  transport.  In  1806,  the  first cars  powered
                    by  an internal  combustion  engine running  on fuel  gas appeared, which  led  to  the
                    introduction  in 1885  of  the  ubiquitous  modern gasoline-or  petrol-fueled  internal
                    combustion  engine.  Cars  powered  by electric power briefly appeared at the turn of the
                    20th century, but largely disappeared from use until the turn of the 21st century. The need
                    to reduce the  amount  of air  pollution generated  by  transportation  has  raised  new interest
                    in electric and hybrid vehicles. The early history of the automobile can  be  divided  into
                    a  number  of  eras,  based  on  the  prevalent  method  of automotive  propulsion  during  that
                    time.  Later  periods  were  definedby trends in exterior styling, and size and utility preferences.

                <p>The name Mercedes Benz needs no introduction for the car enthusiastic people.
                   Ever since its foundation this name has been associated with the world class
                   brand of cars, trucks and buses. The two founding fathers, one is Mr. Karl Benz
                   who first founded this company in 1871 and the two others Mr. Gottlieb Daimler and
                   Mr. Wilhelm May Bach, who founded the division of Mercedes Benz called as Daimler AG
                   in 1890.The headquarters of the Mercedes Benz is located at Baden-Wurttemberg and Stuttgart
                   in Germany.

                    Currentlythis company produces a wide range of advanced luxury cars, trucks and buses in its
                    manufacturing facilities, based all over the world besides Germany.Mercedes-Benz is a German
                    manufacturer of automobiles, buses, coaches, and trucks. It is currently a division of the parent
                    company, Daimler AG(formerly DaimlerChrysler AG), after previously being owned by Daimler-Benz.
                    Mercedes-Benz has its origins in Karl Benz's creation of the first automobile in January 1886,and
                    by Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a carriage by the addition of a 
                    petrol engine the same year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901. The first Mercedes-
                    Benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and 
                    GottliebDaimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company.Mercedes-Benz has introduced many
                    technological and safety innovations that have become common in other vehicles several years later.

                        In 1959, the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach launched an innovative campaign,
                         naming the car the "Beetle" and turning its miniature size as a distinct advantage to consumers.
                          Over the next several years, Volkswagen became the top-selling auto import in the United States.

                        In 1960, the German government vended 60 percent of Volkswagen's stock to the German public, 
                        successfully denationalizing it. Twelve years later, 
                        the Beetle bettered the longstanding worldwide manufacturing record of 15 million automobiles.

                <p>
                    Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz were born only 60 miles apart in southern Germany.
                     Daimler was born March 17, 1834. A decade later, on November 25, Carl Benz was born.
                     Although they grew up with little in common, both boys   were   fascinated   by   machines
                     from   an   early   age.   Because   theirapproach  to  building  cars  was  quite  different,
                     it  is  doubtful,  though,  that they met or even knew what the other was doing. In  1886,
                     Carl  Benz  built  a  motorized  tricycle.  His  first  four-wheeler,  the Victoria, was built
                     in 1893. The first production car was the 1894 Benz Velo which  participated  in  the  first
                     recorded  car  race,  the  Paris-Rouen  race.  In 1895,  Benz  built  his  first  truck.In  1886,
                     Gottlieb  Daimler  literally  built  a horseless  carriage.  In  1888  Daimler  made  a  business
                     deal  with  William Steinway  (of  piano  fame)  to  produce  Daimler's  products  in  the  US.
                     From 1904  until  a  fire  in  1907,  Steinway  produced  Mercedes  passenger  cars, Daimler's 
                     light trucks, and his engines on Long Island.
